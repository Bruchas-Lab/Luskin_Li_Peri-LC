This code was used in Luskin and Li et al. 2025

Data was analyzed in Windows 10 using MATLAB R2021b and R 4.0.3, and we do not anticipate any issues with other systems. All dependencies are included in these files.

The files do not require installation and can be run from the folder they were downloaded to; download time depends on your internet connection.

To run the software, change the directory to point to your data and run. Figures will appear as they are generated; this will allow you to validate the output. Run time depends on your machine. For photometry data, this will take less than 10 minutes. For large single-cell sequencing datasets, this may take several hours.

Instructions to reproduce our quantitative results are included in the manuscript and the code, and places where you should make changes based on your own data are noted.
